# Production Challenges

Production problems in debugging refer to issues that occur when trying to debug and resolve software problems in a live production environment. Debugging in a production environment can be challenging due to various factors, including:

1. ***Limited visibility:*** In a production environment, the debugging process often lacks the comprehensive visibility available in development or test environments. Access to logs, debugging tools, and real-time monitoring may be limited or restricted.

2. ***Reproduction difficulty:*** Some bugs may be hard to reproduce in a controlled environment, making it challenging to identify the root cause. Production environments are typically complex, with various dependencies and configurations that may contribute to the bug.

3. ***Time constraints:*** Debugging in production requires a quick resolution to minimize service disruption. Time pressure can limit the thoroughness of the debugging process, potentially leading to quick fixes or workarounds that may not address the underlying issue.

4. ***Impact on users:*** Debugging in a live environment carries the risk of impacting end users. Any changes or experiments conducted during the debugging process can potentially introduce new bugs or disrupt the user experience further.

5. ***Lack of isolation:*** In a production environment, multiple services or components may interact, making it challenging to isolate the specific cause of a bug. The issue could be due to interactions between different systems, data inconsistencies, or external factors.

6. ***Resource constraints:*** Production environments often have limited resources, such as memory, CPU, or network bandwidth. These constraints can exacerbate debugging efforts, as traditional debugging techniques that rely on extensive logging or code instrumentation may not be feasible in a resource-constrained environment.

7. ***Security concerns:*** Production environments may have stricter security measures in place, which can restrict certain debugging capabilities. For example, access to sensitive data or system internals may be limited or require additional authentication and authorization.

8. ***Non-reproducible bugs:*** Production bugs are not always easy to reproduce, and they may occur under specific circumstances or due to rare race conditions. In such cases, it can be challenging to debug the problem without having a consistent way to reproduce it. It's important to gather as much information as possible when the bug occurs, including relevant logs, stack traces, and any user input or system state details. Additionally, consider using tools like distributed tracing or APM (Application Performance Monitoring) solutions to gain visibility into the system behavior.

To address these challenges, it's essential to follow best practices when debugging in production, such as:

- Logging and monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms to gather relevant data and gain insights into the system behavior. This includes capturing relevant error logs, application metrics, and performance data.

- Incremental deployments: Adopt a deployment strategy that allows for incremental changes and rollbacks, enabling quick reversions if issues arise during debugging.

- Controlled experiments: When possible, conduct controlled experiments, such as canary releases or A/B testing, to minimize the impact on users and validate potential fixes before deploying them widely.

- Tracing and observability: Utilize distributed tracing and observability tools to track requests and understand the flow of data across different services, aiding in identifying bottlenecks or problematic interactions.

- Collaboration and communication: Foster effective collaboration between development, operations, and support teams to share information, diagnose issues, and coordinate efforts during debugging.

By combining these practices with thorough analysis and a systematic approach to troubleshooting, developers can effectively debug and resolve production problems while minimizing disruption to end users.

### Modern Infrastructure Challenges to Production Debugging

Today’s infrastructures are becoming more and more distributed. While this is mostly to maintain big applications efficiently, it is difficult to debug because it is difficult to trace the bug back to its source. In a distributed application, there are many moving parts, and when a problem occurs in the system, it must first be isolated to see its origin.

An example of such a phenomenon is serverless computing. Not only does it use a distributed architecture, but it represents an abstraction of the underlying application infrastructure and its abilities. In this architecture, the application is decoupled at the functional level, which is single-purpose, programmatic functions hosted on managed infrastructure.

Therefore, it’s almost impossible for a developer to perform a debugging process in normal conditions because the application does not run in a local environment.

Under these circumstances, developers need to gather enough information to solve the problem directly from the running application (function in case of serverless). Therefore, a remote troubleshooting procedure is required. As mentioned earlier, production debugging can also be done remotely through a remote debugging process.


### Why should you not use “Debug Mode” in Production?

The answer is “performance”. Using Development mode, or enabling debugging on an eSpace in Production, adds debugging symbols to the compiled code. This greatly increasing its size (and therefore how much RAM it uses) as well as significantly slowing down its execution speed. You won’t notice the difference in a development or QA environment, but load hundreds or thousands or users against it and there will be a difference for sure.
