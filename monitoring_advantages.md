**1. Decision Making :**

It is important to monitor and evaluate your progress in order to make good decisions about how to proceed, and an effective monitoring and evaluation approach can help you do that. It can be extremely difficult for an organization to determine whether or not to cancel a project or to decide what program the organization should develop next, as these are some of the hardest decisions to make. 


**2. Input monitoring:**

When evaluating the impact that an input has on a project, the monitoring components are helpful. With tracking, you can see whether you’re making progress or squandering time and money on something that isn’t productive. You may also see whether any more tools are required for completion. You now have the option of either adding additional resources to the initiatives or stopping the investments.

**3. Improved project performance:**

Keeping track of the progress of a project is crucial to your understanding of how it is performing and whether or not it is accomplishing what you had expected, within the time frame and resources that you had allocated for it. Monitoring helps you determine if the project is performing as expected. 

**4. Communicates the current situation in a simple and direct manner:**

One of the benefits of monitoring and evaluation is that it can help communicate the current situation of a program or project in a simple and direct manner. By collecting and analyzing data, monitoring and evaluation can provide insights into program performance, including progress made towards goals and objectives, challenges faced, and areas for improvement. This information can then be presented in a clear and concise manner to stakeholders, such as program managers, donors, and beneficiaries, enabling them to understand the program’s current situation and make informed decisions moving forward.

**5. Making the world a better place through initiating change:**

You can tell whether your project has had a favorable or bad effect on the public by keeping tabs on its progress and seeing how they respond. At the conclusion of this procedure, you will have gathered all the relevant information and analysed it to get insight into the anticipated and unforeseen outcomes of your project.

**6. The Future Project Roadmap:**

It might be difficult to devise a long-term strategy and build initiatives for the future. There are many potential ways ahead to pursue, but constricting factors like time and money make it difficult to settle on a manageable set of initiatives and a distinct direction to go in. In addition to gaining insight into the status of ongoing initiatives, monitoring and evaluation will equip you to better gauge the success of potential future endeavors.


**7. Saves resources and time:**

Another benefit of monitoring and evaluation is that it can save resources and time. By regularly tracking progress and assessing performance, monitoring and evaluation can help identify areas where resources are being used inefficiently or ineffectively. This information can then be used to make necessary adjustments and allocate resources more effectively, ultimately saving time and money. Additionally, monitoring and evaluation can help identify issues early on, before they become larger problems that require more resources to address. This proactive approach can help prevent waste and reduce costs in the long run.

**8. Effectively aids organizations in maintaining order and staying organized:**

M&E helps with tracking the progress of implementation and record keeping. As discussed, Evaluation is an essential component of any successful program or activity. By monitoring and evaluating these programs and activities, organizations can better understand their effectiveness, where improvements need to be made, and how successes should be repeated.

**9. Overall progress report:**

A project’s success depends on the satisfaction of its constituents, who may have to wait a while before they see tangible benefits. Regularly updating stakeholders on initiatives is much easier with a comprehensive status report. Further funding for project growth may be secured as a result of the status report. As an added bonus, it may prevent you from throwing money at initiatives that have little chance of succeeding.

**10. Learning for the future:**

M&E helps you grow and improve your skillset. As an organisation, there are always areas where you may grow and expand. Organizations may improve their practices over time by carefully analyzing their successes and failures.

**11. Benefits for different stakeholders:**

- *Beneficiaries* -
Using data collection and follow-up processes (after the implementation of the project is complete) can be an indication that an organization is truly interested in the results and is working to improve them. Data collection can be used both to improve the efficiency of implementation and to improve the design of implementation (so that beneficiaries will see better outcomes)
- *Employees* - When there is a clear effort to not only measure progress but also make use of this data to improve the ability of the organization to deliver impact, monitoring an evaluation can increase trust in the organization’s commitment to its mission. It is also important to note that conducting evaluation assessments can also increase trust between employees who work directly with beneficiaries (i.e., “on the ground”) as well as between the beneficiaries themselves.

- *Executive management* - Monitoring and Evaluation processes provide a way of collecting, analyzing, and analyzing continuous data that can be used to determine changes to strategic direction. As a result, the process of implementing change becomes much more agile. Executives can build much more persuasive arguments by providing relevant and comprehensive data (both process-related and impact-related).
- *Funders* - Good Monitoring and Evaluation implementation can help open up the flow of money for impact so that it can come from the place of the data. It can breed credibility in the impact and, of course, give us a better understanding of how much impact we can generate for each investment dollar.

**12. Provide proof of success (or failure) to interested parties**

Monitoring and evaluation can offer conclusive proof of whether or not a programme is producing the desired results by gathering and analysing data on programme performance. To illustrate the impact and efficacy of the programme, this data can be shared with stakeholders such programme funders, partners, and beneficiaries. Monitoring and evaluation can offer helpful information on what is not working and why, enabling for adjustments to be made to improve performance in situations when a programme is not producing the anticipated results. Monitoring and evaluation can assist stakeholders develop a sense of trust and accountability while also ensuring that programmes are producing the desired results.
