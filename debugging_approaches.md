## Debugging Approaches/Strategies: 

- **Brute Force:** Study the system for a larger duration in order to understand the system. It helps the debugger to construct different representations of systems to be debugged depending on the need. A study of the system is also done actively to find recent changes made to the software.

- **Backtracking:** Backward analysis of the problem which involves tracing the program backward from the location of the failure message in order to identify the region of faulty code. A detailed study of the region is conducted to find the cause of defects.

- **Forward analysis:** Forward analysis of the program involves tracing the program forwards using breakpoints or print statements at different points in the program and studying the results. The region where the wrong outputs are obtained is the region that needs to be focused on to find the defect.
Using past experience with the software debug the software with similar problems in nature. The success of this approach depends on the expertise of the debugger.

- **Cause elimination:** it introduces the concept of binary partitioning. Data related to the error occurrence are organized to isolate potential causes.

- **Static analysis:** Analyzing the code without executing it to identify potential bugs or errors. This approach involves analyzing code syntax, data flow, and control flow.

- **Dynamic analysis:** Executing the code and analyzing its behavior at runtime to identify errors or bugs. This approach involves techniques like runtime debugging and profiling.

- **Collaborative debugging:** Involves multiple developers working together to debug a system. This approach is helpful in situations where multiple modules or components are involved, and the root cause of the error is not clear.

- **Logging and Tracing:** Using logging and tracing tools to identify the sequence of events leading up to the error. This approach involves collecting and analyzing logs and traces generated by the system during its execution.

- **Automated Debugging:** The use of automated tools and techniques to assist in the debugging process. These tools can include static and dynamic analysis tools, as well as tools that use machine learning and artificial intelligence to identify errors and suggest fixes.
