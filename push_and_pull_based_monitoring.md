## Pull-based

- As the name implies, is a monitoring system that actively obtains indicators, and the objects that require monitoring need to have the capability to be accessed remotely.

## Push-based

- monitoring systems do not actively obtain data, but the monitored objects actively push indicators.

There are differences between the two methods in many aspects. For the construction and selection of monitoring systems, we must understand the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods in advance and choose the appropriate scheme for implementation. Otherwise, the subsequent maintenance cost of ensuring the stability of the monitoring system and the cost of deployment and O&M will be huge.
